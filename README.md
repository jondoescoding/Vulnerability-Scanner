# Python Vulnerability Scanner

This is a simple python script which:
- Scans ports on a computer
- Determines whether or not the scanned port is open or closed
- If after connecting to a socket and a port is open, the script will accept data from the socket and put it into a readable format
- prints out if any vulnerability banner is found and compares it against a predefined list in a text file  

## How to run
### Method #1
- Simply run from an IDE such as VSCode or Atom

### Method #2
- Open the command prompot of your choice
- Navigate to the folder where the script is being held 
- Run the script by using: python scanner.py in your prompt and the code should run autonomously on its own after
